    <p><strong><em>Dynamic.</em></strong> That is the word that can best be used to describe the art of the Futurists, a group of artists active from around 1909-10 through the early 1930's. The Futurist artists were fascinated by movement and objects in motion, and how to depict these principles in painting and sculpture. The works of the Futurists placed heavy emphasis on speed and youth, while glorifying objects that reflected these principles, such as the car, the airplane, and the industrial city. While the majority of the movement's artists were Italian and Russian, futurist artists were active in England, Portugal, and other areas. The futurists in Russia were also highly influenced by Cubism, and are commonly referred to as the "Cubo-Futurists."</p> <p>Many credit the beginning of the Futurist movement in art to the publication of the <em>Manifesto of Futurism</em> by Italian poet Filippo Tommaso Marinetti. The manifesto was both a celebration of speed, machinery, industry, and youth and a call to arms for the modernisation and cultural rejuvenation of early 1900's Italy. Inspired by Marinetti's concept, artists in Italy including Giacomo Balla, Umberto Boccioni, Gino Severini, and Carlo Carr√† began to transcribe Futurism to the visual arts.</p> <p>Soon, the movement began to pick up steam in Russia. Like in Italy, Futurism began in Russia with literature, with the publication of the Hylaea literary group's manifesto, entitled <em>A Slap in the Face of Public Taste.</em> Russian artists with Cubo-Futurist works include Mikhail Larionov, Natalia Goncharova (whose painting is above), Kazimir Malevich, and Olga Rozanova. This site is dedicated to the memory of this interesting, yet short-lived movement in art's history.
